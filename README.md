## Kirby compatibility table

| Kirby version | Compatible plugin version |
|:--------------|:--------------------------|
| ^3.7          | ^3.0                      |
| ^3.6          | ^2.0                      |
| ^3.5          | ^1.0                      |

## Usage

Add the following blueprint to wherever you would like the navigation field to appear:

```yaml
fields:
  navigation:
    label: Navigation
    type: navigation
    levels: 5
    help: Description of menu or where it is used
    width: 1/2
```

Two Field methods are included which will output the menu regardless of how many levels deep you go:

```php
<?php echo $site->navigation()->toNavigationMarkup(); ?>
```

If using the site as a headless CMS or would like to consume your menu in JS you can use the following field method to return an array of menu items:

```php
<?php $site->navigation()->toNavigationArray(); ?>
 ```

Or when using Kirby Query language

```json
{
  "query": "site",
  "select": {
    "title": "site.title",
    "navigation": "site.navigation.toNavigationArray"
  }
}
```

If you would like full control of your menu and would prefer to use a foreach to create the menu, that could look something like this:

```php
  <?php if($site->navigation()->isNotEmpty()): ?>
    <ul>
      <?php foreach($site->navigation()->toStructure() as $nav): ?>
        <li>
          <a href="<?php echo $nav->url(); ?>" <?php e($nav->isOpen(), 'aria-current') ?>>
            <?php echo $nav->text() ?>
          </a>
          <?php if($nav->children()->isNotEmpty()): ?>
            <ul>
              <?php foreach($nav->children()->toStructure() as $child): ?>
                <li>
                  <a href="<?php echo $child->url() ?>">
                    <?php echo $child->text() ?>
                  </a>
                </li>
              <?php endforeach ?>
            </ul>
          <?php endif ?>
        </li>
      <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>
  <?php endif ?>
```

## Info

Nesting limit is set as default to 5, to allow further levels adjust the levels option in the blueprint
